The best practice for setting the timezone in your Django instance is to use **UTC** (Coordinated Universal Time) for the backend (server-side) and let the application adjust for users based on their local time zone. This is because:

1. **Consistency**: UTC is the same everywhere, so you avoid issues with daylight saving time changes or timezone differences when storing or processing data.
2. **Data Integrity**: Storing data in UTC ensures consistency, especially if you have users across different time zones or if your system is used globally.
3. **Easy Conversion**: You can convert UTC to the user's local time zone in the frontend, which provides a more localized experience for your users.

So, you can set `TIME_ZONE` to `'UTC'` in your Django settings and configure `USE_TZ = True` to ensure all datetime objects are stored in UTC in the database.

On the frontend (in JavaScript or user interfaces), you can display the time in the user's local time zone.

In Django, your settings would look like this:

```python
TIME_ZONE = 'UTC'
USE_TZ = True
```

If your users are primarily located in one specific region (for example, if your app is just for a single city or country), you might also want to set the `TIME_ZONE` to your local time zone for convenience in development, but it's still recommended to store times in UTC.
